# 📩 SMS Spam Detection System  
**Machine Learning & NLP Project | Python • Scikit-learn**

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project is a machine learning–based SMS spam detection system that classifies text messages as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)**.  
It uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to clean and transform text data and applies trained machine learning models to accurately detect unwanted spam messages.
